### Showcases a middle tier built with peasy-js.

A full implementation of a middle tier built using the [peasy-js framework](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js) and consumed by [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) can be found here.  You can clone the repo (```git clone https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js-samples.git```) or download the entire solution as a [zip](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js-samples/archive/master.zip).

The sample application is a ficticious order entry / inventory management system.  All efforts were made to keep this application as simple as possible to focus on how a middle tier can be written with peasy-js and consumed by multiple clients (client and server).

### Requirements

1. [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) - this application is a nodejs application and therefore must be installed.
2. [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), [fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler), [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html), or similar - these tools help to facilitate communications with http endpoints.
3. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (**optional**) - this application by default is configured to work with in-memory data proxies, however, you can easily swap data proxies to interact with a mongodb instance if desired. See [MongoDB Configuration](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js-samples/wiki/Configuring-Client-%E2%86%92-Web-API-%E2%86%92-MongoDB) for more details.

### Running the application

From a command line, navigate to the peasy-js-samples directory and run:

1. ``` npm install ```
2. ``` npm run start ```

By default, the client (react) application is configured to use http implementations of the [data proxies](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/Data-Proxyy) that communicate with the Web API.  In turn, the Web API ic configured to use in-memory data proxies. However, there are a few configuration possibilities.  The [configurations](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js-samples#configurations) section provides details on setting up many potential configurations.

### Configurations

#### Client &#8594; In-Memory

In this scenario, the client consumes [business services](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/BusinessService) that are injected with [data proxies](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/Data-Proxy) that communicate with in-memory data stores.

#### Client &#8594; Web API &#8594; In-Memory (Default configuration)

In this scenario, the client consumes [business services](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/BusinessService) that are injected with [data proxies](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/Data-Proxy) that use HTTP to communicate with the Web API application.  In turn, the Web API application uses business services that are injected with data proxies that communicate with in-memory data stores.

#### Client &#8594; Web API &#8594; MongoDB

In this scenario, the client consumes [business services](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/BusinessService) that are injected with [data proxies](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/wiki/Data-Proxy) that use HTTP to communicate with the Web API application.  In turn, the Web API application uses business services that are injected with data proxies that communicate with a MongoDB database.

### Testing out the Web API

With the application up and running you can navigate to the following urls:

* [http://localhost:3000/customers](http://localhost:3000/customers)
* [http://localhost:3000/orders](http://localhost:3000/orders)
* [http://localhost:3000/orderitems](http://localhost:3000/orderitems)
* [http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products)
* [http://localhost:3000/categories](http://localhost:3000/categories)
* [http://localhost:3000/inventoryitems](http://localhost:3000/inventoryitems)

### Web API Walkthrough

[This walkthrough](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js-samples/wiki/API-Walkthrough) covers creating a customer, category, product, and placing an order on behalf of the new customer.  It also covers submitting and shipping an order to see how it affects inventory.

### Running the unit tests

[peasy-js](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js) was designed with unit testing in mind, and as a result, each actor in the application has corresponding unit tests, located in the [*/spec*](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js-samples/tree/master/spec) directory.

To run the tests, navigate to the */spec* directory from a command line and run the following command:

``` jasmine ```
